YES

Problem:
 +(x,0()) -> x
 +(x,s(y)) -> s(+(y,x))
 +(+(x,y),z) -> +(x,+(y,z))
 +(x,y) -> +(y,x)

Proof:
 Church Rosser Transformation Processor (ac):
  f3_AC(x,0()) -> x
  f3_AC(x,s(y)) -> s(f3_AC(y,x))
  AC critical peaks: joinable
  AC-KBO Processor:
   precedence:
    f3_AC > s ~ 0
    weight function:
     w0 = 2
     w(0) = 3
     w(s) = 1
     w(f3_AC) = 0
