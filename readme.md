# Grackle-CSI in CoCo2025

Grackle-CSI solves the largest number of problems in [CoCo2025](https://project-coco.uibk.ac.at/2025/).
CoCo is the annual confluence competition for rewrite systems.

Rewrite system is tightly related with lambda calculus and Alan Turing and Alonzo Church's research on computability theory.
