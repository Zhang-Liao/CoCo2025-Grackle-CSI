You used a processor that relies on Yices internally.
However, Yices is not supported by this build of TTT2.
YES

Problem:
 f(f(f(f(x)))) -> f(f(f(g(x,f(x)))))
 f(x) -> g(x,f(x))

Proof:
 Church Rosser Transformation Processor (no redundant rules):
  strict:
   f(x) -> g(x,f(x))
  weak:
   
  critical peaks: 0
  Closedness Processor (*feeble*):
   
   Qed
