Problem:
 0(1(2(1(x)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(x))))))))))
 0(1(2(1(x)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(x)))))))))))))
 0(1(2(1(x)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(x))))))))))))))))
 0(1(2(1(x)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(x)))))))))))))))))))
 0(1(2(1(x)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(x))))))))))))))))))))))
 0(1(2(1(x)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(x)))))))))))))))))))))))))
