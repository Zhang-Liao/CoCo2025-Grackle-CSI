YES

Problem:
 +(0(),x) -> x
 +(1(),-(1())) -> 0()
 +(+(x,1()),-(1())) -> x
 +(x,+(y,z)) -> +(+(x,y),z)
 +(+(x,y),z) -> +(x,+(y,z))
 +(x,y) -> +(y,x)

Proof:
 Church Rosser Transformation Processor (ac):
  f4_AC(0(),x) -> x
  f4_AC(1(),-(1())) -> 0()
  f4_AC(f4_AC(x,1()),-(1())) -> x
  AC critical peaks: joinable
  AC-RPO Processor:
   precedence:
    f4_AC > 0 > - > 1
